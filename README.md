# Wizardly Challenge by Kristin Dragos

## About ##

This game is a project for Udacity's VR Developer Nanodegree program. The project was designed for and tested with an Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers, and an HTC Vive. The goal is to create a Rube Goldberg machine and get a ball to a goal. Users will need to teleport around, building their own machine using planks, a convayor belt/lift, a bounce pad, and other objects to get the ball through the goal. 

## Enhancements ##


Multiplatform support for both Oculus and Vive. Unique tutorial text for each platform. 
A tutorial mode, designed to teach players the controls of the game. 
Four levels. 
Custom built (Using Blender) objects to build with. Includes a convayor belt/lift, a funnel, and a curved track.


## Challenges and Reflection ##

My biggest challenge was trying to test for both HTC Vive and Oculus. My computer only has one HDMI port, so I couldn't have both headsets plugged in at the same time. This made testing difficult. I ended up needing to think of the project as two separate projects within one Unity app. Instead of switching between the headsets to test one new feature, I'd test with one headset, building out the whole game. Once the whole game was done, I switched headsets and tested it, adding only platform specific additions. 

I really like how everything turned out. I get really excited when I can make my own custom models in Blender and get them working in Unity the way I want them to. 

## Potential Future Additions ##


Adding a timer to each level to build a sense of urgency for players. 
Add a way for players to give up a level or quit it and go back to the starting scene. 
Add some sort of intro splash screen.
